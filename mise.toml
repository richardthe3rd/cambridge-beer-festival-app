# Base mise configuration for all environments (including CI)
# For developer-specific tools (Claude, Firebase), use: MISE_ENV=dev mise install
#
# Task Configuration:
# - Each task can have a 'description' (short summary)
# - Tasks with arguments use 'usage' field with KDL syntax for arg/flag definitions
# - Arguments become available as $usage_<name> env vars (e.g., $usage_file)
# - For complex tasks, consider using file-tasks in .mise/tasks/ for better editing
#   Docs: https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/task-arguments.html
