# Sandboxed Environment Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Only needed for sandboxed environments (e.g., Claude Code Web)
# Desktop Claude Code and local development do NOT need these settings
#
# Load with: MISE_ENV=sandboxed mise install
# Combined with dev: MISE_ENV=sandboxed,dev mise install
#
# Why these settings exist:
# - Sandboxed environments have restrictions on git operations
# - libgit2 and gix cause "Failed to configure the transport" errors
# - Disabling them allows mise to use alternative git methods

[settings]
# Disable libgit2 and gix to prevent Flutter installation errors in sandboxed environments
libgit2 = false
gix = false
