# Test Setup

## Mocks

Mock files (e.g., `services_test.mocks.dart`) are generated by Mockito and committed to source control. This ensures:
- Tests run without requiring build_runner
- Mock implementations are visible in code reviews
- Faster CI builds
- More predictable builds

If you add new `@GenerateMocks` annotations, regenerate mocks with:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Then commit the updated mock files.

## Running Tests

```bash
flutter test
```
